      The current global warming rate is not natural. From 1880 to 1981 was
      0.07°C per decade. Since 1981 this rate has increased to 0.18°C. The total
      average global temperature rise since the industrial revolution is around
      1.0 °C. Earth northern hemisphere is warming faster. The arctic has warmed
      between 2 °C and 4 °C.

  <p-card header="CO2">
    <p>
      For thousands of years, the natural concentration of CO2 in earth
      atmosphere was around 280 ppm. From the beginning of the industrial
      revolution, human activities like the burning of fossil fuels,
      deforestation, and livestock have increased this amount by more than 30%.

  <p-card header="Methane">
    <p>
      Methane is a flammable gas formed by geological and biological processes.
      Some of the natural ones are leaks from natural gas systems and wetlands.
      50-65% of total global methane emissions come from human activities. These
      include livestock, agriculture, oil and gas systems, waste from homes and
      businesses, landfills, and so on. Methane is a gas with a global warming
      potential several times stronger than of CO2. For more than 650,000 years,
      methane concentration in the atmosphere was between 350 – 800 ppb. From
      the beginning of the industrial revolution, human activities have
      increased this amount by around 150%.

  <p-card header="NO2">
    <p>
      Nitrous oxide is a gas that is produced by the combustion of fossil fuel
      and solid waste, nitrogen-base fertilizers, sewage treatment plants,
      natural processes, and other agricultural and industrial activities. It is
      the third largest heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere and the biggest
      ozone-destroying compound emitted by human activities.

  <p-card header="Arctic Ice">
    <p>
      The arctic is warming around twice as fast as global average. Some of the
      reasons for this are: The arctic amplification, the albedo effect, and
      black carbon. From 1979 to 1996, we lost 2.2 – 3% of the arctic ice cover.
      From 2010 to present we are losing 12.85% per decade! Another consequence
      is permafrost thawing. This is a process in which large amounts of methane
      is released to the atmosphere, fueling more the process of global warming.
